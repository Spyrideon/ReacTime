ReacTime - Reaction Time Tester

A simple program that measures a user's reaction time using randomized delays and visual feedback. 
The project allows running multiple reaction tests, storing the results, and visualizing reaction times on a graph.

---- Overview ----
This project is designed to test how fast a user reacts to a visual stimulus. 
Each test includes an unknown (random) delay to prevent anticipation. 
Once the delay ends, the screen changes and the user must click as quickly as possible. The reaction time is recorded and saved for analysis.

Over multiple tests, the collected data can be displayed in a graph to compare reaction times across different delays.

---- Features ----
  Run any number of reaction time tests
  Randomized, unknown delay before each test
  Visual cue indicating when to click
  Measures reaction time with high precision
  Stores reaction times for later analysis
  Displays results in a graph
  Reaction time vs. delay
  Easy comparison across tests

  ---- Tech ----
  Programming Language: C++
  Visualization Library: SFML
